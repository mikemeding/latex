%REQUIREMENTS
%
%As a core member of the Tulip team, you love startups â€“ the ownership and responsibility that comes with building peerless tools and products as well as the fluctuating requirements and fast iterations that come with creating the best product possible. You jump in wherever work has to be done and can take a project from start to finish on your own.
%
%You have experience developing large, production-ready applications. You're comfortable working on the whole stack, from backend API endpoints, to databases, to frontend development and UX.
%
%We don't require experience with any specific technologies, but we use Meteor, MongoDB, Postgres, Node.js, jQuery, and d3.

\opening{Dear Natan,} 

I am writing you because Tulip was recently brought to my attention by one of my professors Fred Martin.
As he may have mentioned to you one of my primary focuses while getting my masters degree has been 3D printing and as I am due to graduate in the spring I am actively seeking a full time postion.
I belive I would be a good fit for Tulip as my research and personal expericece in full stack web deveopment would fit with the design flow at Tulip.
Working for a small startup for the past few years has also made me no stranger to fast iterations and having to wear many hats while working.

My current research is building a 3D print slicer which integrates with an IoT enabled 3D printer to allow for seamless and wireless 3D printing.
As I am aware this is similar in spirit to the design of your manaufacturing software which is also an IoT enabled platform.
If you are interested, links to all of my research and personal projects can be found at my website www.mikemeding.com

I look forward to hearing from you.

\closing{Best,}
